Originating in a rented house, the organization has grown to encompass over 630 branches globally, accompanied by an equal number of Dastarkhwans, employing thousands. Presently, the organization allocates an monthly budget exceeding a billion for humanitarian services. Encompassing more than 63 facets of life from birth to death, including areas such as food, health, education, social welfare, clean water, marriage, mass I.T training, vocational training, aid to Syrian and Burmese refugees, pilgrim services, school fees, easy loans, employment assistance, hairdressing, medical facilities, diagnostic services, x-rays, ultrasounds, ECGs, consultant clinics, mobile dining, mobile clinics, mobile air care clinics, and operation theaters, our organization is dedicated to serving humanity, especially during natural disasters.
